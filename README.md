# Castaway - The Podcast App

Castaway is my pet project and my personal digital playground where I am learning new technologies, concepts and developing the best coding standards.
At the same time I want to provide an open source cross platform podcast app.

For now this is a pure Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) Project. With a native UI, SwiftUI on iOS side and Jetpack Compose on Android side. 
The Goal of this Project is to bring as much common logic as possible into the shared module while providing a beautiful native UI.
